title: Regrades
---

If you want a test or assignment regraded, you should make a request to Dushoff within a week of when it was made available to you.

I will regrade whole questions (as indicated by the numbers), in consultation with the original marker.
You can specify which (whole) questions you want regraded, though.
Your grade for the questions regraded can go up or down. 

If you have issues about the _question_ or the _key_, you should discuss these with me _before_ requesting a regrade.

To request a regrade email dushoff@mcmaster.ca, explaining which question or questions you want regraded, and any comments you have about the marking, put the original test or assignment in an envelope for Dushoff, and leave it in the Biology main office (LSB 2nd floor).

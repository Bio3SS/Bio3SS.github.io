* Dushoff will be in Ghana for an Ebola workshop during the coming week. Dr. Ben Bolker will lecture on the regular material on Tuesday and Wednesday. There will be no class on Friday.

* Tutorials this week are optional. They will focus on exam review and on the last section of Unit 2 (the part not covered in the midterm)

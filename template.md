**Academic Integrity**

> You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all
> aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are
> rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. **It is your
> responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.**
>
> Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that
> results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This
> behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero
> on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript
> (notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty"),
> and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. For information on
> the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the
> [*[Academic Integrity
> Policy]{.underline}*,](https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/Academic-Integrity-Policy-1-1.pdf)
> located at
> https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/university-policies-procedures-
> guidelines/
>
> The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:

-   plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one's own or for
    > which other credit has been obtained.

-   improper collaboration in group work.

-   copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.

**Authenticity/Plagiarism Detection**

***Some courses may*** use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal
authenticity and ownership of student submitted work. For courses using
such software, students will be expected to submit their work
electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via an online learning
platform (e.g. Avenue to Learn, etc.) using plagiarism detection (a
service supported by Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for academic
dishonesty.

Students who do not wish their work to be submitted through the
plagiarism detection software must inform the Instructor before the
assignment is due. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does not
submit work to the plagiarism detection software. **All submitted work
is subject to normal verification that standards of academic integrity
have been upheld** (e.g., on-line search, other software, etc.). For
more details about McMaster's use of Turnitin.com please go to
[[www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity]{.underline}.](http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity)

**Courses with an On-line Element**

***Some courses may*** use on-line elements (e.g. e-mail, Avenue to
Learn, LearnLink, web pages, capa, Moodle, Echo360, Microsoft Teams,
ThinkingCap, etc.). Students should be aware that, when they access the
electronic components of a course using these elements, private
information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster
e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all
other students in the same course. The available information is
dependent on the technology used. Continuation in a course that uses
on-line elements will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have
any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with
the course instructor.

**\
Online Proctoring**

**Some courses may** use online proctoring software for tests and exams.
This software may require students to turn on their video camera,
present identification, monitor and record their computer activities,
and/or lock/restrict their browser or other applications/software during
tests or exams. This software may be required to be installed before the
test/exam begins.

**\
Conduct Expectations**

As a McMaster student, you have the right to experience, and the
responsibility to demonstrate, respectful and dignified interactions
within all of our living, learning and working communities. These
expectations are described in the *[[Code of Student Rights &
Responsibilities]{.underline}](https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/Code-of-Student-Rights-and-Responsibilities.pdf)*
(the "Code"). All students share the responsibility of maintaining a
positive environment for the academic and personal growth of all
McMaster community members, **whether in person or online.**

It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online,
as the Code remains in effect in virtual learning environments. The Code
applies to any interactions that adversely affect, disrupt, or interfere
with reasonable participation in University activities. Student
disruptions or behaviours that interfere with university functions on
online platforms (e.g. use of Avenue 2 Learn, WebEx, Echo360, Microsoft
Teams or Zoom for delivery), will be taken very seriously and will be
investigated. Outcomes may include restriction or removal of the
involved students' access to these platforms.

**\
Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities**

contact [[Student Accessibility
Services]{.underline}](https://sas.mcmaster.ca/) (SAS) at 905-525-9140

**\
Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work**

**\
Academic Accommodation for Religious, Indigenous or Spiritual
Observances (RISO)**

Students requiring academic accommodation based on religious, indigenous
or spiritual observances should follow the procedures set out in the
[[RISO]{.underline}](https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/2019/02/Academic-Accommodation-for-Religious-Indigenous-and-Spiritual-Observances-Policy-on.pdf)
policy. Students should submit their request to their Faculty Office
***normally within 10 working days*** of the beginning of term in which
they anticipate a need for accommodation [or]{.underline} to the
Registrar\'s Office prior to their examinations. Students should also
contact their instructors as soon as possible to make alternative
arrangements for classes, assignments, and tests.

**\
Copyright and Recording**

Students are advised that lectures, demonstrations, performances, and
any other course material provided by an instructor include copyright
protected works. The Copyright Act and copyright law protect every
original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, **including

The recording of lectures, tutorials, or other methods of instruction

You can get up to two extra points for class participation by interactively answering the questions posed during lecture. This is intended to encourage active listening and lecture participation. Please do not answer questions or ask for participation points on a day when you do not participate in the live lecture.

# Registration 

To get credit for class participation, please [register for the class with the Poll Everywhere service](https://www.polleverywhere.com/register?p=3g4gd-fzxy&u=zKaCdjgv). You must __register under your McMaster email__ so that we will know who you are.

# Cost 

Poll Everywhere says that there is no additional fee __beyond your regular texting fee.__ In the event that you have trouble with fees, you can try  the web interface instead. 

# Alternative 

If you are unable or unwilling to use Poll Everywhere, you can get credit by sending Dushoff an email with comments, thoughts or ideas related to each missed question (not simply the answers, since it's sort of too late for that) by 4 PM on class day. This should be done only if you have actively engaged with the lecture.

# Credit 

If you participate consistently, you will receive 2 points on your grade. Allowances will be made for difficulties starting up PollEverywhere. If your participation is inconsistent, your 2 points will be pro-rated.

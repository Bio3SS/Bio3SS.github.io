There will be no attempts at intrusive monitoring. There will however be an honor statement, and you should take it seriously. 

## Preparation
* Make sure you have your Mac-standard calculator ready, and that you have a quiet place to work with good internet
* Prepare to spend an hour out of touch with the rest of the world (just as you would for a regular exam)

## Test

* Download and review the [resource sheet pdf (midterm2.resource.test)](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/le/content/413706/viewContent/3129640/View) from Content/Midterm 2 on Avenue. This will be available at 8:25
* Next, fill in the [test on Avenue](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/lms/quizzing/user/quizzes_list.d2l?ou=413706). This will be available at 8:30
* The normal test time is 45 minutes; because of possible internet issues, I have alloted 50 (+2 minute grace period); you should make every effort to finish on time.

## Contact
* For questions having anything to do with content or meaning, please chat to me on Teams.
* I will respond to most substantive questions on the [Teams midterm 2 channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae436585c048446d9b15242c64ca85d9b%40thread.tacv2/Midterm%25202?groupId=eb56dbf5-4cb5-4f4c-b52e-c3efd7dda1c6&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772); you might want to monitor it. If something seems important to me, I will use @channel (which should give you an alert if you have Teams on).
* You should also use the [channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae436585c048446d9b15242c64ca85d9b%40thread.tacv2/Midterm%25202?groupId=eb56dbf5-4cb5-4f4c-b52e-c3efd7dda1c6&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772) for _technical_ questions that apply to _everyone's_ exam 
	* you can't find something, you can't download something, etc.
* Do not communicate with anybody in any other way during the test time

## Statement

Within two hours of completing your test, please:

* [Email me](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) from your McMaster address to say "I certify that I completed the 3SS exam without any assistance of any kind."

I take the honor statement seriously, and trust that you will, too.
Your test _will not be graded_ without it.

The tutorials are mandatory, and we take this requirement seriously.  In particular, if you do not attend tutorials, you should try very hard not to bother the course team with questions of the sort that are addressed in tutorials.

Your official tutorial section is the one you are officially registered for.  Assignments must be handed in via that tutorial, and questions about assignment logistics will be handled via that tutorial.  Your official tutorial is the only one where you are ''entitled'' to a seat.

If you would like to attend another tutorial, please send a message to Marvin Gunderman.

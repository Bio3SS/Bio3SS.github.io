We will announce each week whether there will be tutorials, and whether the tutorial for the week is (conceptually) mandatory. 

You are encouraged to use tutorials (optional and mandatory) as the first option for asking questions about the course; if you do not attend tutorials, you should try not to bother the course team with questions you could ask in tutorial.

If you would like to switch tutorials, please [talk to your TA](team.html)

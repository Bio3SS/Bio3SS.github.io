We will announce each week whether there will be tutorials, and whether the tutorial for the week is mandatory. Attendance at mandatory tutorials is part of your assignment grade.

You are also encouraged to use tutorials (optional and mandatory) as the first option for asking questions about the course; if you do not attend tutorials, you should try not to bother the course team with questions of the sort that are addressed in tutorials. 

If you would like to switch tutorials, please talk to your TA (FB message is probably a good way to reach them).

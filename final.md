title: Final exam
---

The final exam will be at 7:30 PM on Monday 26 April. It is scheduled for two hours. 

The exam is _cumulative_, but with extra emphasis on material not yet tested.

There will be 40 MC questions, you should prepare a Mac-standard calculator.

There will be no attempts at intrusive monitoring. There will be an honor statement, and you should take it seriously.

# Instructions

Before the test:
* Make sure you have your calculator ready, and that you have a quiet place to work with good internet
* Prepare to spend two hours out of touch with the rest of the world (just as you would for a regular exam)

At 19:30 on Monday:

* First, download and review the resource sheet from Teams or Avenue
* Next, fill in the exam on Avenue

I will be available on the Teams Exam channel for the course of the exam. I will @ the channel if there is any new information or important clarifications. You may also chat me directly on Teams if you have a question that does not apply to others. Do not communicate with anyone else in any manner during the exam.

Before 11 PM, please:

* [Email me](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) from your McMaster address to say "I certify that I completed the 3SS exam without any assistance of any kind."

Have a safe, sane and enjoyable summer!

# Resources

* Below are some previous final exams. The length and style of questions will be matched by this year's final, but the material covered will be slightly different. Don't worry if there are things there that I didn't quite cover this year.

* Nonlinear: 5
* Structure: 2
* Life history: 8

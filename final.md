The final exam will be at 9 AM on Tuesday 11 April. It will last two hours.

The exam is _cumulative_, but with a little extra emphasis on material not yet tested (Units 6 and 7).

There will be 40 MC questions, and you should bring your Mac-standard calculator.

* Below are some previous final exams. The length and style of questions will be matched by this year's final, but the material covered will be slightly different. Don't worry if there are things there that I didn't quite cover this year.

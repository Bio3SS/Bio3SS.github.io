The final exam will be at 9 AM on Monday 27 April. It is scheduled for two hours. Further information will be forthcoming.

The exam is _cumulative_, but with extra emphasis on material not yet tested.

There will be 40 MC questions, you should prepare a Mac-standard calculator.

There will be no attempts at intrusive monitoring. There will be an honor statement, and you should take it seriously.

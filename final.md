title: Final exam

The final exam will be at 9:00 AM on Mon 25 April, in person in a room to be assigned by the Registrar. It is scheduled for two hours. 

The exam is _cumulative_, with extra emphasis on material not yet tested.

There will be 40 MC questions, you should prepare a Mac-standard calculator.

There will be no attempts at intrusive monitoring. There will be an honor statement, and you should take it seriously.

# Instructions

Before the test:
* Make sure you have your calculator ready, and that you have a quiet place to work with good internet
* Prepare to spend two hours out of touch with the rest of the world (just as you would for a regular exam)

At 19:30 on Monday:

* First, download and review the resource sheet from Teams or Avenue
* Next, fill in the exam on Avenue

I will be available on the Teams Exam channel for the course of the exam. I will @ the channel if there is any new information or important clarifications. You may also chat me directly on Teams if you have a question that does not apply to others. Do not communicate with anyone else in any manner during the exam.

Before 11 PM, please:

* [Email me](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) from your McMaster address to say "I certify that I completed the 3SS exam without any assistance of any kind."

If you have student-oriented _public-interest_ announcement you would like to share, please [email me (Dushoff)](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca).
Public-interest announcements include charitable or environmental initiatives, but not explicitly political ones (including particularly McMaster student offices), and nothing commercial.

Usually the best thing is to ask me to post your announcement here (and to Avenue). It is possible to talk to the class, but only:

* by prior arrangement with me
* one person speaking
* speak from 26 after to 29 after the hour (finish up as soon as it clicks to 29)
* If you want to use a slide, you should send it to me as pdf.

You may not _pass_ a signup sheet, collection box, etc. If you want to hang around (or come back), you can _leave_ something at the front.

* If you object to my rejecting your request, please let me know, but it probably won't affect my opinion.
* If you object to my _accepting_ somebody else's request, please let me know; it probably _will_ affect my opinion, particularly if you have a clear reason.

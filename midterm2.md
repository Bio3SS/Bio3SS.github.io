title: Midterm 2
---

Information about coverage and format will be posted as available.
The midterm will cover Units 4 and 5, and Unit 6 up to the beginning of S2.2. 
Units 1, 2, and 3 will be given relatively less emphasis, since they have already been tested.

There will be no attempts at intrusive monitoring. There will however be an honor statement, and you should take it seriously. 

## Preparation
* Make sure you have your Mac-standard calculator ready, and that you have a quiet place to work with good internet
* Prepare to spend an hour out of touch with the rest of the world (just as you would for a regular exam)

## Test

* Download and review the [resource sheet pdf (midterm2.resource.test)](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/le/content/371137/viewContent/3129640/View) from Content/Midterm 2 on Avenue. This will be available at 8:25
* Next, fill in the [test on Avenue](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/lms/quizzing/user/quizzes_list.d2l?ou=371137). This will be available at 8:30
* The normal test time is 45 minutes; because of possible internet issues, I have alloted 50 (+2 minute grace period); you should make every effort to finish on time.

## Contact
* For questions having anything to do with content or meaning, please chat to me on Teams.
* I will respond to most substantive questions on the [Teams midterm 2 channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae436585c048446d9b15242c64ca85d9b%40thread.tacv2/Midterm%25202?groupId=eb56dbf5-4cb5-4f4c-b52e-c3efd7dda1c6&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772); you might want to monitor it. If something seems important to me, I will use @channel (which should give you an alert if you have Teams on).
* You should also use the [channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae436585c048446d9b15242c64ca85d9b%40thread.tacv2/Midterm%25202?groupId=eb56dbf5-4cb5-4f4c-b52e-c3efd7dda1c6&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772) for _technical_ questions that apply to _everyone's_ exam 
	* you can't find something, you can't download something, etc.
* Do not communicate with anybody in any other way during the test time

## Statement

Within two hours of completing your test, please:

* [Email me](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) from your McMaster address to say "I certify that I completed the 3SS exam without any assistance of any kind."

I take the honor statement seriously, and trust that you will, too.
Your test _will not be graded_ without it.

Between 13 and 19 Mar, maybe? Think about lectures or sessional span?

Midterm 2 is on Fri 26 Mar. 

The midterm will be _cumulative_, but with more emphasis on material not yet tested. It will cover through Unit 5 Section 3.

Please arrive promptly, with your Mac-standard calculator, a pencil for multiple-choice questions, and a pen for short-answer questions. Please wait _outside_ the classroom until we call you, so that we can set up the room.

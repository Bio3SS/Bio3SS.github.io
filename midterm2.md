Between 13 and 19 Mar, maybe? Think about lectures or sessional span?

Midterm 2 is on Fri 13 Mar. 

The midterm will be _cumulative_, but with more emphasis on material not yet tested. It will cover through Unit 5 Section 3.

Please arrive promptly, with your Mac-standard calculator, a pencil for multiple-choice questions, and a pen for short-answer questions. Please wait _outside_ the classroom until we call you, so that we can set up the room.

# Resources

Practice tests and study questions are provided as study aids. Material content and coverage will change slightly from year to year. If it's not mentioned in the notes we're covering for the test, you don't need to know it. Test keys will be released on Tuesday

2017 was apparently posted in 2019, but now it's gone?

{% comment %} 
Midterm 2 will be held in our classroom during class time on Fri 25 Mar. 

The midterm will focus on Units 5 and 6, and Unit 7 through the end of S3.1
There will be some questions from earlier units as well. 

There will be 25 multiple-choice questions and no short-answer questions.

Please arrive promptly, with your Mac-standard calculator, a pencil for multiple-choice questions, and a pen for short-answer questions. Please wait _outside_ the classroom until we call you, so that we can set up the room.

Welcome to Population Ecology (Bio 3SS). I am Jonathan Dushoff.

I am hoping to run this course smoothly through Teams, and kind of hoping you-all can help me figure out what works and what doesn't work.

For now, we have three communication channels:

* The [course resource page](/index.html); this is where I actually organize the course
* The [course Avenue page](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/home/371137); this is where I'm used to getting people's attention
* The [course Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a287c0954220846839d68910ac2084692%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=eb56dbf5-4cb5-4f4c-b52e-c3efd7dda1c6&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772)

Since we will hold class on Teams, I'm thinking it might be best to try to do most of the communication through there. Please let me know your thoughts by [email](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) or on the [Teams "classroom" channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ad2cbbfd7f003419ea5071d2ceb626a2f%40thread.tacv2/Classroom?groupId=eb56dbf5-4cb5-4f4c-b52e-c3efd7dda1c6&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772). You all have more experience with this stuff than I do!

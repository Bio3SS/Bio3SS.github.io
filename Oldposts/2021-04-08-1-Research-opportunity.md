Here is [the video I showed this morning in class](https://mcmaster.zoom.us/rec/share/joBM1QEuBz1cNawra9doUcEqvTc_aYw-RuU4abiIkXDNdSFmQCFRbhpbOrIg5pat.KPn_hkk7rR4W_PZW?startTime=1617632490000). Dr. Quinn adds:

The job starts in early May with a possibility of a couple of outings before then at a mutually convenient time.  However, this assumes we are in a good place with covid and McMaster administration at the time.  Last year, hiring was delayed by a month.

You can [contact him](mailto:quinn@mcmaster.ca) for further information.

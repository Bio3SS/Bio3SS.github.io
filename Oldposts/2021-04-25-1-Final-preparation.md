I have updated the [final exam page](/final.html) with some instructions for tomorrow.

I will monitor the Study Hall channel tomorrow and will answer any questions posted before 4 PM by 6 PM. I do not promise to respond to anything posted after 4 (but I do promise to _not_ respond to questions about the subject matter posted after 6 PM â˜º)

* We will meet tomorrow (Tue) at 0830 (sorry!) on the [Introduction channel of our MS team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a83bcf9115c5c4855bb3bfa19b43dd28d%40thread.tacv2/Introduction?groupId=eb56dbf5-4cb5-4f4c-b52e-c3efd7dda1c6&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772). Please wait for me to start the meeting, so that we only get one meeting.

* Please download the [Handouts for the Introductory Unit](/materials/intro.handouts.pdf) and have them ready for class on Monday. I usually advise people to print them and scribble on them (you will definitely want to take notes), but in these weird lockdown days you may have a better idea than me

* There is also a [math supplement handout](/materials/math.handouts.pdf) available for you to review.

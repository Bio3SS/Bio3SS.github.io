We use google spreadsheets because they provide a free and easy way to share simple models.

* You can view, but not edit, the google spreadsheet from class. You are encouraged to play around  but you first need to go to `File/Make a copy` to get your own copy.

* If you are used to some other spreadsheet program (like Excel), you can choose instead to go to `File/Download as` and get a format that you like better.

_Good luck!_

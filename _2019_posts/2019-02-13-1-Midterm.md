The midterm will be during class time on Thursday (Happy Valentines!).

* Please bring your __McMaster-approved__ calculator, a #2 pencil for the scantron and a pen for the short-answer questions.

* Please arrive on time, but don't go in until we call you. We need to set up the classroom first.

* We will need your help to get everything done on time. Please follow instructions carefully.

Thanks for your co-operation.

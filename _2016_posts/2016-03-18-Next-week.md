* The [new assignment](../../../materials/competition.asn.pdf) is due on _Monday_ (Friday is a holiday)

* Tutorials this week will review the Competition unit, including the code that you need for the assignment.

* We will:
    * regrade the exam to add points for those unfairly penalized by Dushoff's wrong answer (but not remove points for those unfairly rewarded), then
    * curve the exam, because it was apparently too hard.

New MC scores should be up next week. Your SA score should already be up; if it's not, please context your TA.

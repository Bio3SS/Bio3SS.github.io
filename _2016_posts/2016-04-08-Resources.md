* You can look at [last year's final](../../../materials/final_2015.test.pdf). The length and style of questions will be matched by this year's final, but the material covered will be slightly different. Don't worry if there are things there that I didn't quite cover this year.

* The [complete notes](../../../materials/disease.complete.pdf) from the [disease unit](../../../disease.html) are also available.

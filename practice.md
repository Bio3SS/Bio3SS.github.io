To prepare for the practice exam, please:

* have your Mac-standard calculator ready
* make sure your computer is plugged in or well charged
* make sure you have a good internet connection, and try to limit competing uses
* set aside two hours to do the exam (including reviewing the resource sheet)

To do the exam:

* download and skim the [resource sheet](materials/practice.test.pdf)
* open [the practice exam](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/lms/quizzing/user/quiz_summary.d2l?qi=115368&ou=315235) and follow instructions

The content is old, and some of the questions might be a bit hard based on this year's coverage. Try not to let that bother you.

Please let us know of any technical or formatting issues we can address to make the final go more smoothly

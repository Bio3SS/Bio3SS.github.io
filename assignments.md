## Assignments 

Most weeks we will have a short-ish assignment. The current not-for-credit assignment is probably a good example.  We will skip exam weeks, and only about half of the assignments will be marked for credit.

You should plan to take time every week to do the assignment, whether we will mark it or not.

The _current_ plan is to _release_ for-credit assignments on:

* 30 Jan
* 27 Feb
* 6 Mar
* 25 Mar

The plan will depend on how busy the course team is.

## Policies

_Please_ read these policies

* [Assignment policy](/assignment_policy.html)
* [Collaboration policy](/Collaboration.html)

Also, here is [a rant](/rant.html) that I posted a few years ago when I was less mellow, or the students were less subtle. Make of it what you will.

## Dropboxes

On the first floor of the Life Sciences building. The "bank" of dropboxes is in two sections between Rooms 115 and 116, near the door to the lobby. Our dropboxes are on the lower right (one for each TA).

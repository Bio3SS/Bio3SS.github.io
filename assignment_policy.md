_You are reminded to follow:_

* [The McMaster Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.mcmaster.ca/policy/Students-AcademicStudies/AcademicIntegrity.pdf)
* [Our course policy on collaboration](Collaboration.html).

Assignments are due Friday at 4 PM in the drop boxes on the first floor of the Life Sciences Building (LSB). Put your assignment in the box labeled with the course name and your TA's name. 
Your assignment should have your name (and MacID), and your tutorial section number (or day and time) at the top.
* We are still working on setting up drop boxes for 2019. Please stay tuned.

_If you have a good reason_, you may submit until Monday at noon, with a 10% penalty. 

Assignments submitted after noon on Monday will not be graded, but assignments can be reweighted with a letter from the Associate Dean.

You can reach your TA through Avenue

_You are reminded to follow:_

* [The McMaster Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.mcmaster.ca/policy/Students-AcademicStudies/AcademicIntegrity.pdf)
* [Our course policy on collaboration](Collaboration.html).

Assignments are due Monday at noon by [email to your TA](/team.html).  Your assignment should have your name (and MacID), and your tutorial section number (or day and time) at the top.

* _We are still working on setting up drop boxes for 2019. Please stay tuned._

_If you have a good reason_, you may submit until Tuesday at noon, with a 10% penalty. 

Assignments submitted after noon on Tuesday will not be graded, but assignments can be reweighted with a letter from the Associate Dean.

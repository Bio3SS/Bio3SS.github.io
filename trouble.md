Installing
==========

Make sure you are connected to the internet to install software or
packages.

You should also be connected to the internet to `source`
from an http location.

Windows Vista {#windows_vista}
=============

If you install R as administrator (which is the normal way to do it in Vista),
you *may* need to run R (or rstudio) as administrator as well.

-   It may also work to install using R instead of rstudio

You may have trouble running rstudio on Vista if R is running; if this
happens, then quit both and restart rstudio.

Sizing
======

If your plot is too crowded, or R refuses to plot it, your \"plot
window\" may be too small.

You can try:

-   manually making your plot window bigger
-   using R instead of rstudio
-   telling R to make the legend and labels smaller (see
    [the BirthDeath page](materials/bd.export.html))

title: Collaboration guidelines
---

We catch people collaborating improperly every year, and _it is no fun for us, or for them._ Don't do it.

# Guidelines 

* You are free to talk to TAs and other students about your assignment, and to seek help _in general terms_: e.g.:
	* what does this mean? 
	* how should I approach it?

* The calculations, descriptions and graphs you turn in should be your own. 

The best way to communicate about assignments is _verbally_.  Do not take any specific written (or typed) notes away from a discussion about how to do an assignment.  If somebody shows you how to do something on the computer, practice until you understand, then go away and do it again by yourself.

# Electronic communication 

* If you communicate electronically about assignments, you should do it _only through the class Facebook site_.

* Communications there should follow the guidelines above: _general_ discussion of how to do things.

* Do not post R code or specific answers

* When using others' electronic advice or suggestions, follow the guidelines above: read it, close it, do your own work. Do not have Facebook open while you are working on your assignment.

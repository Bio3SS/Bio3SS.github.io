title: Collaboration guidelines
---

We catch people collaborating improperly every year, and _it is no fun for us, or for them._ Don't do it.

# Guidelines 

* You are free to talk to TAs and other students about your assignment, and to seek help _in general terms_: e.g.:
	* what does this mean? 
	* how should I approach it?

* The calculations, descriptions and graphs you turn in should be your own. 

The best way to communicate about assignments is _verbally_.  Do not take any specific written (or typed) notes away from a discussion about how to do an assignment.  If somebody shows you how to do something on the computer, practice until you understand, then go away and do it again by yourself.

# Electronic and other written communication 

* _No_ electronic or other _written_ communications about assignments are allowed, _except_ on:
  * [The official class Facebook site]({{site.facebook}})
  * [The class Avenue to Learn site]({{site.avenue}})

* Communications there should follow the guidelines above:
  * _general_ discussion of how to do things.
  * Do not post R code or specific answers
  * When using others' electronic advice or suggestions, follow the guidelines above: read it, __close it__, do your own work.

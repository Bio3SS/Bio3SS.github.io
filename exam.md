title: Final exam

The final exam will be frighteningly soon!

The exam is _cumulative_, but with a little more emphasis on material not yet tested (Units 6 and 7).

There will be 40 MC questions, and you should bring your Mac-standard calculator.

# Resources
* You can look at [last year's final](../../../materials/final_2015.test.pdf). The length and style of questions will be matched by this year's final, but the material covered will be slightly different. Don't worry if there are things there that I didn't quite cover this year.

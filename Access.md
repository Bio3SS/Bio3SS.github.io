I have no control over access to this course through the computer system (although I do grant waivers, see below).

The course often seems full, but you will probably get in if you keep trying.

# Waivers 

Waivers for Bio 3SS will be granted to qualified students who do not have the prerequisite, __starting in November.__  This is to give students with the prerequisite the first chance at the course.

You should have at least one introductory course with some coverage of ecology (e.g., Bio 1M or 1AA) and an upper-level course with some relationship to evolution or ecology.  You must also acquire a copy of the Ecology textbook (Molles and Cahill).

If you would like a waiver, please send an email to dushoff@mcmaster.ca, explaining which courses you have taken to meet these requirements and stating that you are willing to be personally responsible for learning concepts you may require from second-year ecology.  Please also include your student number. 

Although you will probably get in, you should be aware that the waiver _does not guarantee you a spot in the course._  The waiver will allow you to try to register for the course online, once you receive confirmation from the department that the waiver has been processed.

## Equivalent courses 

If you have had a second-year or third-year Ecology course at another university you can have a waiver right away, if you want it. Please send an official or unofficial transcript, and a link to a description of the course you took. You should also follow all the email instructions above, except for the one about waiting until January.

## Conditional waivers 

If you are enrolled for Bio 2F03 in the summer term, you may have a conditional waiver for this prerequisite.  Please send an email with your student number, stating that you are currently enrolled in 2F and would like a conditional waiver.

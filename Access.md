I have no control over access to this course through the computer system (although I do grant waivers, see below).

The course sometimes seems full, but you will probably get in if you keep trying.

Don't worry if you don't have Avenue access yet; everything you need should be on [this site](/)

# Waivers 

If you want to take Bio 3SS without the prerequisite (Bio 2F), you will need a waiver.
Waivers for Jan 2024 are not yet available. I will open the waiver process at some point between 1 Sep (if enrollment is low) and 1 Dec (if enrollment is high). I will announce the date in August.

I will open the waivers process for 2021 on 1 Sep.

You should have at least one introductory course with some coverage of ecology (e.g., Bio 1M) and an upper-level course with some relationship to evolution or ecology.

You must also acquire a copy of the Ecology textbook (Molles and Cahill).
This is no longer available, and nobody was paying attention!

If you would like a waiver, please [send an email to dushoff@mcmaster.ca](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca),
explaining which courses you have taken to meet these requirements and stating that you are willing to be personally responsible for learning concepts you may require from second-year ecology.  Please include your macid (that's the email address; you never need to send me your student number)
You must email _after_ the opening date (not now!) because I want to be sure that you are still interested before I ask an administrator to process your waiver.

Although you will probably get in, you should be aware that the waiver _does not guarantee you a spot in the course._  The waiver will allow you to try to register for the course online, once you receive confirmation from the department that the waiver has been processed.

## Equivalent courses 

If you have had a second-year or third-year Ecology course at another university you can have a waiver right away, if you want it. Please send an official or unofficial transcript, and a link to a description of the course you took. You should also follow the email instructions above.

## Conditional waivers 

If you are enrolled for Bio 2F03 in the summer term, you may have a conditional waiver for this prerequisite.  Please send an email with your student number, stating that you are currently enrolled in 2F and would like a conditional waiver.

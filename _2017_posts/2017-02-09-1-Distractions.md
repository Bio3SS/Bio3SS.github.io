I have received some complaints, so I am sending a reminder.

If you are planning to watch a movie, play a full-screen video game, or do other dramatic, non-class things during class:

* You are absolutely not allowed to do this.

* If you do it anyway, please have the courtesy to do it where _nobody_ can see you. Don't sit next to anybody; don't sit in front of anybody; don't sit in the front 2/3 of the classroom.

* Also, don't do it.

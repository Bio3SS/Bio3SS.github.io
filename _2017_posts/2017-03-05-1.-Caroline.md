Hi everybody,

Next week, I will not have office hours (out of the country). I will check the facebook group so feel free to ask questions on the page. If you prefer using emails, you can ask questions at cauretc@mcmaster.ca . I will have office hours the following week (week of March 13) and you can also ask for appointments that week.

Have a good day and weekend.

If you wrote Version 5, you either had a missing number for Q18, or a number that caused nonsense if you did the problem correctly. This is 100% my fault (Dushoff), and I apologize for the inconvenience. We will mark the problem as generously as possible for you, but I understand that doesn't cover all the damage. I try very hard to be careful, and I'm really sorry that I messed up here.

The V5 key reflects the correct answer to the correct question, not the question you saw.

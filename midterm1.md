{% comment %} 
Midterm 1 will be held in our classroom during class time on Fri 19 Feb. It will cover Units 1-3 and parts of Unit 4.

There will be 20 multiple-choice questions (worth 20 points in total) and five points worth of short-answer questions.

Please arrive promptly, with your Mac-standard calculator, a pencil for multiple-choice questions, and a pen for short-answer questions. Please wait _outside_ the classroom until we call you, so that we can set up the room.

* The normal test time is 45 minutes; because of possible internet issues, I have alloted 50 (+1 minute grace period); you should make every effort to finish on time.

## Statement

Within two hours of completing your test, please:

* [Email me](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) from your McMaster address to say "I certify that I completed the 3SS exam without any assistance of any kind."

I take the honor statement seriously, and trust that you will, too.
Your test _will not be graded_ without it.

## Tests

All versions are similar. MC questions are scrambled, but are otherwise the same. SA questions use different values, but are otherwise the same.

It's weird but irrelevant that Version 5 is labelled "Deferred" instead of "Version 5".

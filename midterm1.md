Midterm 1 will be held during class time on Tue 23 Feb. Information about coverage and format will be posted as available.

Midterm 1 will be held strictly during class time on Tue 23 Feb (8:30-9:20). 
The midterm will cover Units 1, 2, and 3.

There will be no attempts at intrusive monitoring. There will however be an honor statement, and you should take it seriously. Because of logistical issues raised by students, you will not be asked to photograph your work.

## Preparation
* Make sure you have your Mac-standard calculator ready, and that you have a quiet place to work with good internet
* Prepare to spend an hour out of touch with the rest of the world (just as you would for a regular exam)

* You may be asked to photograph or scan some of your answers. Be prepared.

Please arrive promptly, with your Mac-standard calculator, a pencil for multiple-choice questions, and a pen for short-answer questions. Please wait _outside_ the classroom until we call you, so that we can set up the room.

## Test
* Download and review the [resource sheet pdf (midterm1.resource.test)](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/le/content/371137/Home) from Content/Midterm 1 on Avenue. This will be available at 8:25
* Next, fill in the [test on Avenue](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/lms/quizzing/user/quizzes_list.d2l?ou=371137). This will be available at 8:30
* The normal test time is 45 minutes; because of possible internet issues, I have alloted 50 (+1 minute grace period); you should make every effort to finish on time.

## Contact
* For questions having anything to do with content or meaning, please chat to me on Teams.
* I will respond to most substantive questions on the [Teams midterm 1 channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/conversations/Midterm%201?threadId=19:c3dfa92b76b14ccb80eb4b234054c7c6@thread.tacv2&ctx=channel); you might want to monitor it. If something seems important to me, I will use @channel (which should give you an alert if you have Teams on).
* You should also use the [channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/conversations/Midterm%201?threadId=19:c3dfa92b76b14ccb80eb4b234054c7c6@thread.tacv2&ctx=channel) for _technical_ questions that apply to _everyone's_ exam *you can't find something, you can't download something, etc.
* Do not communicate with anybody in any other way during the test time

## Statement

Within two hours of completing your test, please:

* [Email me](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) from your McMaster address to say "I certify that I completed the 3SS exam without any assistance of any kind."

I take the honor statement seriously, and trust that you will, too.
Your test _will not be graded_ without it.

The midterm will focus primarily on Units 2 and 3, but _may_ also include _conceptual_ questions from Sections 1 and 2 of Unit 4 (no calculations will be required from Unit 4).

There will be 17 multiple-choice questions (worth 17 points in total) and two short-answer questions (worth 8 points in total).

## Tests

All versions are similar. MC questions are scrambled, but are otherwise the same. SA questions use different values, but are otherwise the same. It's weird but irrelevant that Version 5 is labelled "Deferred" instead of "Version 5".

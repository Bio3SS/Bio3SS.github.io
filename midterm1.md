{% comment %} 
Midterm 1 will be held in class on Fri 9 Feb. Please arrive promptly, with your Mac-standard calculator. Please wait _outside_ the classroom until we call you, so that we can set up the room.

The midterm will cover Units 1 through 3. 

The midterm will focus primarily on Units 2 and 3, but _may_ also include _conceptual_ questions from Sections 1 and 2 of Unit 4 (no calculations will be required from Unit 4).

* [Complete notes for the covered part of Unit 3 (not intended for printing)](/materials/structure_prelim.complete.pdf)

There will be 17 multiple-choice questions (worth 17 points in total) and two short-answer questions (worth 8 points in total).

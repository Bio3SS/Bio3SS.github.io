Midterm 1 will be held strictly during class time on Tue 23 Feb (8:30-9:20). 
The midterm will cover Units 1, 2, and 3.

There will be 25 MC questions, you should prepare a Mac-standard calculator.

Preparation
* Make sure you have your calculator ready, and that you have a quiet place to work with good internet
* Prepare to spend an hour out of touch with the rest of the world (just as you would for a regular exam)
* You may be asked to photograph or scan some of your answers. Be prepared.

There will be no attempts at intrusive monitoring. There will however be an honor statement, and you should take it seriously.
Please arrive promptly, with your Mac-standard calculator, a pencil for multiple-choice questions, and a pen for short-answer questions. Please wait _outside_ the classroom until we call you, so that we can set up the room.

The midterm will focus primarily on Units 2 and 3, but _may_ also include _conceptual_ questions from Sections 1 and 2 of Unit 4 (no calculations will be required from Unit 4).

There will be 17 multiple-choice questions (worth 17 points in total) and two short-answer questions (worth 8 points in total).

# Tests

All versions are similar. MC questions are scrambled, but are otherwise the same. SA questions use different values, but are otherwise the same. It's weird but irrelevant that Version 5 is labelled "Deferred" instead of "Version 5".

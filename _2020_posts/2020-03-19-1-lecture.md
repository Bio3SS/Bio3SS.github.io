Webex has been having issues (and Mac still hasn't given me a real Webex account!), so we will try my [zoom meeting room](https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/6566254502) instead for tomorrow.

Most of you should be familiar with this room from tutorials, but I will make an effort to set it up by 9 AM tomorrow for people who want to make sure that they can attend.

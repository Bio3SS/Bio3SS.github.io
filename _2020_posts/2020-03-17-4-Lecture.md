Tomorrow's lecture will be at the usual time. We'll use [Professor Bolker's Webex room](https://mcmaster.webex.com/join/bolkerb) one more time.

If you didn't join yesterday, it's probably worth testing in advance. I will have it open by 9:10 and will look for one or more fun biology videos to show before class starts.

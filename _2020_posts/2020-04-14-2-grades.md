I have posted the midterms and keys to the [midterm page](/midterm2.html). Apologies! I was not aware I hadn't done that.
If you asked me for the answers, I didn't notice, I thought people were asking for grades.

I have attempted to post midterm and assignment grades to Avenue. Sorry that took so long as well, but there were technical issues on that one.

So far, there is no plan for returning marked stuff or review. That might have to wait until COVID calms down.

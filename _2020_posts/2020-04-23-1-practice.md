Thanks to all who have provided feedback about the practice test!

Please remember to access the practice test through the [page here](/practice.html), and to follow the directions there; particularly the point about starting with the resource sheet.

I am aware that separating similar questions is annoying, but I'm still thinking it's going to be the best way to balance issues of fairness during this unusual exam. I am still open to more feedback.

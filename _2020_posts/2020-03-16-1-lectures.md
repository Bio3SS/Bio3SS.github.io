You will be aware that McMaster has cancelled all in-person classes and exams. We will attempt to continue 3SS online to the extent possible. I am optimistic that not much needs to change except the part about going to the classroom.

For now, lectures will take place online at the usual time. I will send more information today about tomorrow's lecture.

I _still_ haven't heard from the University about getting a Webex room. So, with Prof. Bolker's kind indulgence, we will once again be meeting in [his Webex room](https://mcmaster.webex.com/meet/bolkerb)

If you don't have experience, please try the room in advance. I will leave it open from around 7-8PM, and again starting around 9AM.

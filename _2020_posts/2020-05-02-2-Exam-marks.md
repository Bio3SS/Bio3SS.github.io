The exam was too hard. This is my fault: I compensated for the fact that it was open book by being extra tricky (which I still think was a good idea), but unfortunately I overdid it.

I will curve the exam marks by increasing the “odds” that you got a question right by 30%. This is not as dramatic as it sounds. Your percentage grade will be transformed from S to ρS/(1-S+ρS), where ρ=1.3.

I will also adjust your total test average using a power adjustment so that people who did really badly in one test don't get unduly punished. Again, this probably won't add up to much.

The marks should be up soon on Avenue.

I have posted midterm 2 grades to Avenue. Sorry for delays.

I do not calculate grades on Avenue, so there is nothing there that makes sense except for your score.

I did not enter any zeroes. I entered NAs for MSAFs. It looks to me like Avenue changed these to zeroes. Your MSAF will be reflected in your final grade.

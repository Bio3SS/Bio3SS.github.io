* I _tried_ to post the midterm marks on Avenue. This is my first time doing that, so I don't know whether it worked on not. Hopefully, somebody can say on FB whether they can see their mark or not.

* The test average is 73%. Last year, the marks were too high, so I made this test harder. My goal is an average between 77 and 80; so I may make later tests a bit easier (or you-all can work harder), and I may also eventually decide to curve this one.

* If other people have marks but you don't, the scantron machine didn't like your scantron (you probably didn't bubble your version number). It will be sorted eventually. Please email me (link below) with your student number and version number.

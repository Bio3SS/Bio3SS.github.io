I have posted exam grades on Avenue and will send final marks to the registrar tonight.

Your Avenue grade is not your grade. Tests will all be curved, and then combined using a "power average" that adaptively puts more weight on tests where you did better. Corrections after Avenue posting are not made on Avenue, but should be reflected in your final grade.

Have a great summer!

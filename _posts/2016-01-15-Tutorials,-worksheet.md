Tutorials for the week of 18 January are will focus on:

* Your [not-for-credit assignment](../../../materials/intro.asn.pdf), due 22 Jan. 
* Foundational concepts from lecture

_You are expected to attend the tutorial_. We don't try to enforce this; we expect you to take your own responsibility seriously. If you don't attend tutorial, we will have limited interest in helping you.

This week's
[not-for-credit assignment](../../../materials/intro.asn.pdf)
will be very useful for most of you to get ready for impending for-credit assignments. You are expected to do it.

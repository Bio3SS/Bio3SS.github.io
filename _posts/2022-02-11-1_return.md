I will lecture in person (ITB-137) today (Friday).

You are encouraged to join in person. You should come prepared to show your MacCheck green checkmark, wear a mask and make reasonable efforts to remain distanced, even though strict distancing rules do not apply in learning environments.

For those who are not comfortable joining in person, we will make every effort to provide a similar online experience to the current one. _You are still expected to attend lectures in real time (virtually or in person) whenever possible, and tutorials in real time when requested._ Please do not attempt to obtain participation marks if you are not actively engaged with the lecture in real time. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

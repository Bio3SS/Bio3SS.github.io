* Please work through the _not-for-credit_ [intro to R worksheet](/materials/r.export.html) by Fri 11 Feb.

* Tutorials this week will focus mainly on making sure that you can run R so that you will be able to keep up with future assignments. Please make sure to run the script by the end of the week, and to go to tutorial if you need help with it.

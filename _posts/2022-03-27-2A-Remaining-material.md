For the rest of the year, we will be studying the spread of infectious disease. 

Since time seems sufficient, I will do a regular unit on infectious disease, followed by a special unit on coronavirus.

Please let me know what you would like to learn about coronavirus! Otherwise, I'll just have to teach you what I think is cool. I will ask for suggestions at the beginning of class Monday, and also welcome suggestions on [our classroom channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a5e4531e4ad2e42fca308bffc085593c3%40thread.tacv2/Classroom?groupId=88fcb621-4c4c-4603-b746-737c99b739ad&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772)

[Midterm 1](/midterm1) will be administered in person this Friday in ITB-137 during class time. 

Some of you had concerns, and I consulted with the course team and the department, and tried to make the best decision.

If you have additional specific concerns, please let me know by email or Teams chat, and I will see if any accommodations are possible.

Everyone who wants to take the test will have to be on campus; if you can't be on campus for health reasons, or because of MacCheck criteria, please get an excuse from the associate dean. The current plan is to reweight test marks for those who cannot write; please let me know if you have thoughts about this.

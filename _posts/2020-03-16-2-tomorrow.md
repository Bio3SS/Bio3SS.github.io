Tomorrow's lecture will be at the usual time in [Professor Ben Bolker's Webex room](https://mcmaster.webex.com/join/bolkerb) (they didn't give me one yet).

You should try to join before the lecture. I'll keep the room open tonight until about 11 (with a short, fun educational video about orangutans); ideally you should check in and make sure you can use the interface. I'll open the room again tomorrow morning when I can (probably between 9 and 9:10). The lecture will start at 9:30 as usual.

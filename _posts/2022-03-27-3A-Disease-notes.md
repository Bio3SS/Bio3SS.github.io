I have posted [notes for the first part of the disease unit](/materials/disease.handouts.pdf). Please prepare them for Monday's class.

I have also posted [complete notes for the exploitation unit](/materials/exploitation.complete.pdf)

For the rest of the year, we will be studying the spread of infectious disease.

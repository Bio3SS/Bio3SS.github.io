The midterm will be during class time on Friday.

* Please bring your __McMaster-approved__ calculator, a #2 pencil for the scantron and a pen for the short-answer questions.

* Please arrive on time, but don't go in until we call you. We need to set up the classroom first.

* This is our first time giving a midterm in a classroom without fixed desks, and we are short-handed. Time will be a problem. Please follow instructions carefully.

Thanks for your co-operation.

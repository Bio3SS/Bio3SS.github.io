* I remarked the annual survival question because I got it wrong on the key. I gave everyone who made the same mistake as I did full credit, even though the only justification is I didn't want to take points away from other people for my mistake

* I remarked the "nonsense" units question, even though I think it was basically fair (I asked and answered the question exactly in class and in the complete notes). I should have made sure you-all knew that _m_ was a _unit_.

* I curved the test, just a little, since the average was still low.

New marks should be up soon.

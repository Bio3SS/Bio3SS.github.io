* We will be starting the [competition unit](/competition.html) on Monday. Please print the handouts and bring them to class

* Complete notes are now available on the [life history page](/life_history.html); they are recommended for reference, not for printing 

* Next week's tutorials are _optional_; they will focus on midterm prep

Midterm 1 grades are up on Avenue. I'm sorry that it took me so long. There were problems with the scanning to the point where I had to rescan, and then there were still many people who did not bubble either their version or their ID number. Sorry you have to bubble things, but you really do.

Finally, and most worrying, the scores were quite low (class median, 63). I can't find anything wrong with the test, so I'm going to blame the pandemic. There will be some sort of curve, but I can't recommend that you count on that much.

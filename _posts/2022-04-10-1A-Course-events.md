There will be no class and no office hour the week of 11 Apr. Please [send email](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) if you need anything.

There will be regular office hours the week of 18 Apr. I will also respond to questions on Teams that week.

If you would like a review session on Wed 20 Apr (during class time), please email me with topics or questions. If there is enough demand, I will have a session.

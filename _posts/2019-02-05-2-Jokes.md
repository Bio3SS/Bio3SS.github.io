There is [a poll](https://www.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/R5jKLu9e9gjwfKZidehEU) up about whether Dushoff should tell jokes. This is a subject of much discussion among TAs.

Poll everywhere is bad about keeping polls open, but I'll do my best to keep it open this evening and Wed morning, and will follow the vote result.

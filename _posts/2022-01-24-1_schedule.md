Most weeks we will have a short-ish assignment. The current not-for-credit assignment is probably a good example.  We will skip exam weeks, and only about half of the assignments will be marked for credit.

You should plan to take time every week to do the assignment, whether we will mark it or not.

The _current_ plan is to _release_ for-credit assignments on:

* 30 Jan
* 27 Feb
* 6 Mar
* 25 Mar

They will be due the following Friday.

* Our first lecture will be tomorrow (Mon) on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a1fc80ae385c949a986829a2337f05c9f%40thread.tacv2/1641747604325?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%220d80640c-27fb-494f-af0e-30faf02cafb1%22%7d)

* Please download the [Handouts for the Introductory Unit](/materials/intro.handouts.pdf) and have them ready for class. It's a good idea to either print them or load them into some sort of note-taking program, so that you can take your own notes on top of these outline notes. 

* There is also a [math supplement handout](/materials/math.handouts.pdf) available for you to review.

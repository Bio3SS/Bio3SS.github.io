Welcome to Population Ecology (Bio 3SS). I am Jonathan Dushoff.

Unfortunately, it looks like we are in for another "interesting" semester.

I will try to communicate as clearly as possible, and am always open to feedback. A good place for general comments is the [Classroom channel on Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a5e4531e4ad2e42fca308bffc085593c3%40thread.tacv2/Classroom?groupId=88fcb621-4c4c-4603-b746-737c99b739ad&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772). You are also welcome to message me on Teams if you prefer a private communications channel.

I will post all announcements in three places:
* The [course resource page](/index.html); this is where I actually organize the course
* The [course Avenue page](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/home/413706); this is where I'm used to getting people's attention
* The [course Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3apv40J-1SM7O8BP6oXpEQ6a0dgaMRzyngCWh62OIyhEQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=88fcb621-4c4c-4603-b746-737c99b739ad&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772); this is where lectures are held and where we should try to have two-way communication.

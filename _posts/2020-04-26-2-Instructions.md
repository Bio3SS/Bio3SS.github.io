The Bio 3SS final exam will be held Mon 27 April from 9-11 AM. Based on feedback, I will make it as similar as possible to the practice exam in form. 

* You _are_ allowed to use your notes (both my notes and any notes that you took). As a result of this, some of the questions may be a little trickier than usual

* You are _not_ allowed to use _any_ other form of assistance (internet, old exams, talking to people) during the course of the exam
	* I am _not_ going to do any weird computer stuff in an attempt to enforce the rules 
	* I _will_ allow you to go back and forth between test questions.
	* I expect you to respect this decision by following the rules.
	* I will ask you to certify by email that you have done this.

To take the exam, please go to the [final exam page](/final.html) at 9 AM tomorrow and follow the instructions there.

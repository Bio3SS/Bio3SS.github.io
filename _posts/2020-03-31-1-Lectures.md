Very sorry for all of the sound problems. I think it is something to do with webex not playing nicely with linux, so tomorrow's lecture will be in [my zoom room](https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/6566254502). Clumsy screen sharing seems a lot better than losing the whole connection.

Let's wish the computers good luck.

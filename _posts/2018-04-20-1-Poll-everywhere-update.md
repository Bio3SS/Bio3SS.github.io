* I have posted updated Poll everywhere scores on Avenue.

* If your score is lower than you think it should be, please:
	* Go to Poll everywhere and answer the current question with your macid (this is the beginning part of your Mac email, it looks like "lastf3", not like "002113489").
	* Enter your macid using every device or connection method you used to answer actual questions
	* Let me know by email that you have done this. You don't have to ask me or tell me anything else.
	* Wait until I post updated Poll scores on Avenue, and check them.

I am calculating provisional poll grades, and I see a lot of answers that the program can't assign to people.

Please help me get you your points by entering your macid [on PollEverywhere](https://pollev.com/bio3ss). If you've answered questions from different devices or platforms during the year, enter it each way you think you've entered a class answer; there is a program which will try to link all of your virtual identities to your macid.

The poll will automatically close itself from time to time. If you find it closed, let me know so I can reopen it.

The exam was too hard. This is my fault: I compensated for the fact that it was open book by being extra tricky (which I still think was a good idea), but unfortunately I overdid it.

I will curve the exam marks by increasing the “odds” that you got a question right by 30%. This is not as dramatic as it sounds. Your percentage grade will be transformed from $$p$$ to $$p^2$$

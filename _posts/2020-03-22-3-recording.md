Sorry for the technical problems we've been having so far.

I still haven't heard from the University about getting a Webex room.

In the meantime, I did mostly succeed in recording Wednesday's lecture. For those who weren't there, a lot of people had trouble hearing in the middle, so I restarted, which temporarily led to _more_ people _not_ hearing.

The recording is in two parts, and the second one is very long (and I guess mostly blank):

* [Part 1](https://mcmaster.webex.com/mcmaster/ldr.php?RCID=029d583781da464fbc959d79a330c415)
* [Part 2](https://mcmaster.webex.com/mcmaster/ldr.php?RCID=8dfb407b76d4428bac37241330791583)

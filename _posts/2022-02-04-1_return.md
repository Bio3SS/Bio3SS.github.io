Starting next week, you are encouraged to join lectures and tutorials in person. You should wear a mask and make reasonable efforts to remain distanced, even though strict distancing rules do not apply in learning environments.

For those who are not comfortable joining in person, we will make every effort to provide a similar online experience to the current one. _You are still expected to attend lectures in real time whenever possible, and tutorials in real time when requested._

Please let us know if you have any questions.

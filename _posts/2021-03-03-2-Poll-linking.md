PollEverywhere does not always assign answers correctly (or you may not always be using PollEverywhere correctly).

In order to give people as many points as possible, I try to link different PollEverywhere identities to the same macid.

If you didn't get a PollEverywhere score, or you think it's low, please answer [the PollEverywhere macid question](
https://www.polleverywhere.com/free_text_polls/aaQnaLgRZgvWV49SntPf9). If you use different devices, or you sometimes log in in different ways, try answering the question in all the different ways you answer (or have answered) in class. I'll open this again at the end of term, and see what I can do to get everyone their bonus points.

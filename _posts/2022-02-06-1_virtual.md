title: Virtual class tomorrow

I am having viral symptoms. I have had one COVID rapid test, which was negative.

According to regulations, I should not come to campus tomorrow. This means tomorrow's class will be virtual, and will be run from my attic, where the internet is less reliable than my lab.

Sorry for inconvenience. If all goes well, I should be able to teach in person on Wed.

Poll Everywhere gave me about 20 listings with several responses and no personal information. If you got a zero (or a weird Avenue code, like -95 or -99) and don't deserve it, you are probably a victim of this problem.

Probably there's a way to fix it by messing with your account. And you're welcome to try and let me know if you figure anything out.

I have also added a new PollEverywhere poll asking for your MacID (e.g., mine is dushoff). If you didn't get a real PollEverywhere score and should have, please try answering the poll, adding account info, or both.

Sorry for inconvenience.

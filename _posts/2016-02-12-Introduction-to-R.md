Your assignment for the next _two_ weeks is the worksheet at http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/3SS/index.php/Introduction_to_R. It is due on Fri Feb 26. You do _not_ need to hand it in, but you do need to do it. In particular, if you don't do it, you should not bother us about any troubles you have running R after that.

Have a good break!

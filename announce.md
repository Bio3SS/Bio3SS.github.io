* Your assignment for this week is the [Introduction to R worksheet](http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/3SS/index.php/Introduction_to_R). It is due on Fri Jan 3. You do _not_ need to hand it in, but you _do_ need to do it. If you don't do it, you should not bother us about any troubles you have running R after that.

* Tutorials for the week of 23 January are _mandatory_; they will focus on:
	* Review of the [not-for-credit assignment](/materials/intro.asn.pdf) [(key)](/materials/intro.key.pdf). 
	* Population regulation and simple models

Please read our [assignment policy](/assignment_policy.html), particularly the [collaboration rules](/Collaboration.html)

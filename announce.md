Thanks to the person who pointed out that the exponential figure was missing from the handouts. Only one slide did not get processed, but unfortunately, this messed up the numbering for section 4 of the unit.

The [handouts](/materials/intro.handouts.pdf) have been updated. Everything through p8 is the same as the original version. You can print the last few pages, or just go on using the existing mis-numbered notes. Complete notes will be posted next week. 

I have also posted [the missing figure](https://github.com/Bio3SS/Exponential_figures/blob/master/outputs/exponential.Rout.four.pdf)

I did not find other missing material. Things that appear more than once in the slides usually appear just once in the notes. Things that are mostly decorative (like the picture of the chemostat where the bacteria are growing) are often omitted from the notes.
